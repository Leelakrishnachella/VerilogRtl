# 100 Days of Verilog & SystemVerilog Practice 🚀
Welcome to my 100 Days of Verilog & SystemVerilog Practice Challenge!

This repository is a collection of Verilog and SystemVerilog codes I am writing as part of a 100-day journey to sharpen my hardware design and verification skills. Each day, I tackle a new problem, concept, or project to deepen my understanding and improve my proficiency in:

Digital design fundamentals
RTL design and synthesis
Testbench development and verification
Advanced SystemVerilog features
Repository Structure 📂
Day-wise folders: Each day has its own folder, containing the problem statement, Verilog/SystemVerilog code, and any associated testbenches or simulation results.
Documentation: Readme files and comments in the code provide detailed explanations of the approach and concepts used.
Tools & Simulators 🛠️
The projects are tested and simulated using:

ModelSim/QuestaSim
Xilinx Vivado
GTKWave
How to Use 🖥️
Feel free to clone the repository and explore the codes. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced designer, you can use this repository to practice, debug, and experiment with Verilog and SystemVerilog.
